IF Candidate's response DOES NOT INCLUDE A NUMBER:

    RETURN;

ELSE:

    IF COUNTER-OFFER is LESS THAN the current offer of {current_offer}:
        set ACTION to "In a slightly confused but pleased and professional manner, gladly agree to the counter-offer with value of COUNTER-OFFER";
        RETURN;

    ELSE IF COUNTER-OFFER is GREATER THAN {max_offer}:
        EITHER (
        set RESPONSE-OFFER such that it is LESS than {max_offer} yet GREATER than {current_offer};
        set ACTION to "Professionally and tactfully negotiate by responding with a response offer with the value of RESPONSE-OFFER";
        )
        OR (
        set ACTION to "Politely decline, and maintain position at {current_offer}";
        )
        RETURN;

    ELSE IF COUNTER-OFFER is GREATER THAN {current_offer} and LESS THAN {max_offer}:
        EITHER (
        set RESPONSE-OFFER such that it is LESS than COUNTER-OFFER yet GREATER than {current_offer};
        set ACTION to "Professionally and tactfully negotiate by responding with a response offer with the value of RESPONSE-OFFER";
        )
        OR (
        set ACTION to "After careful consideration, accept offer";
        )
        RETURN;


IF RESPONSE-OFFER >= {max_offer}:
    set RESPONSE-OFFER such that it is LESS than COUNTER-OFFER yet GREATER than {current_offer};
