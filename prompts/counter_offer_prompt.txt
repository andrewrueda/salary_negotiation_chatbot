### LOGIC-TREE ###

initialize variable ACTION;
initialzie variable COUNTER-OFFER;
initialize variable RESPONSE-OFFER as a value that is LESS than {max_offer} but GREATER than {current_offer}.

IF Candidate's response DOES NOT INCLUDE A NUMBER:
    ACTION = "Respond appropriately to the message.";

ELSE:
    set COUNTER-OFFER to the value of Candidate's newly proposed salary;

    IF COUNTER-OFFER is LESS THAN the current offer of {current_offer}:
        ACTION = "In a slightly confused but pleased and professional manner, gladly agree to the counter-offer with value of COUNTER-OFFER";

    ELSE IF COUNTER-OFFER is GREATER THAN {max_offer}:
        EITHER:
            set RESPONSE-OFFER such that it is LESS than {max_offer} yet GREATER than {current_offer};
            ACTION = "Professionally and tactfully negotiate by responding with a response offer with the value of $RESPONSE-OFFER";
        
        OR:
            ACTION = "Politely decline, and maintain position at {current_offer}";


    ELSE IF COUNTER-OFFER is GREATER THAN {current_offer} and LESS THAN {max_offer}:
        EITHER:
            set RESPONSE-OFFER such that it is LESS than COUNTER-OFFER yet GREATER than {current_offer};
            ACTION = "Professionally and tactfully negotiate by responding with a response offer with the value of $RESPONSE-OFFER";
        OR:
            ACTION = "After careful consideration, accept offer";


IF RESPONSE-OFFER is GREATER THAN {max_offer}:
    set RESPONSE-OFFER such that it is LESS than COUNTER-OFFER yet GREATER than {current_offer};
