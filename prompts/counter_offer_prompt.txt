<INSTRUCTIONS>
Details: """BE CAUTIOUS BUT WILLING TO NEGOTIATE!
Be willing to respond with counter-offers!
Follow the INSTRUCTIONS, and determine the ACTION."""

initialize variable COUNTER-OFFER;
initialize variable RESPONSE-OFFER as a value that is LESS than {max_offer} but GREATER than {current_offer}.
initialize variable ACTION;

IF Candidate's response DOES NOT INCLUDE A NUMBER:
    set $ACTION to "Respond appropriately to the message.";
    RETURN $ACTION;

ELSE:
    set $COUNTER-OFFER to the value of Candidate's newly proposed salary;

    IF COUNTER-OFFER is LESS THAN the current offer of {current_offer}:
        set $ACTION to "In a slightly confused but pleased and professional manner, gladly agree to the counter-offer with value of COUNTER-OFFER";
        RETURN $ACTION;

    ELSE IF $COUNTER-OFFER is GREATER THAN {max_offer}:
        EITHER (
        set $RESPONSE-OFFER such that it is LESS than {max_offer} yet GREATER than {current_offer};
        set $ACTION to "Professionally and tactfully negotiate by responding with a response offer with the value of $RESPONSE-OFFER";
        )
        OR (
        set $ACTION to "Politely decline, and maintain position at {current_offer}";
        )
        RETURN $ACTION;

    ELSE IF $COUNTER-OFFER is GREATER THAN {current_offer} and LESS THAN {max_offer}:
        EITHER (
        set $RESPONSE-OFFER such that it is LESS than $COUNTER-OFFER yet GREATER than {current_offer};
        set $ACTION to "Professionally and tactfully negotiate by responding with a response offer with the value of $RESPONSE-OFFER";
        )
        OR (
        set $ACTION to "After careful consideration, accept offer";
        )
        RETURN $ACTION;


IF $RESPONSE-OFFER is GREATER THAN {max_offer}:
    set $RESPONSE-OFFER such that it is LESS than $COUNTER-OFFER yet GREATER than {current_offer};

IF $RESPONSE-OFFER is GREATER THAN $COUNTER-OFFER:
    set $RESPONSE-OFFER such that it is LESS than $COUNTER-OFFER yet GREATER than {current_offer};
