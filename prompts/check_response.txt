## INSTRUCTIONS ##

I am going to give you an unstructured list of words. These words were found in an email from a Candidate receiving a job
offer from a company. Judging by this list of words, please determine whether the email in question has stayed on topic about
salary negoatiation, and is continuing the discussion in good faith and in a polite manner. If so, you will respond GOOD, and if not,
you will respond with either RUDE or STRANGE.


This will be determined based on the following criteria:

## CRITERIA ##

-If the list of words contains many words that are associated with jobs, salaries, negotiation, and the professional workplace, it is likely to be GOOD.
-In addition to on-topic words, if the list of words contains multiple polite words, it is even more likely to be GOOD.
-If the list of words is short but contains mostly neutral or common words, it is more likely to be GOOD.

-If the list of words contains curse words, then it is likely to be RUDE.
-If the list of words contains rude or violent words, then it is likely to be RUDE.

-If the  list of words is closely related to a particular topic that is NOT professional negotiations, then it is likely that it is STRANGE.
-If the list of words is very short and contains rarer words not commonly found in a professional email, then it is possible it is STRANGE.

-If the list of words is ambiguous, it is more likely to be GOOD.
