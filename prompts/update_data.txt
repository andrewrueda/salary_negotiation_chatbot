<INSTRUCTIONS>
I am going to give you an EMAIL that is part of a salary negotiation.

They will be discussing the correct SALARY AMOUNT as part of the negotiation.

If there is a currency value that is a NEW offer amount in the negotiation:
    set NEW-OFFER-AMOUNT to the new amount;
    If NEW-OFFER-AMOUNT is {compare} than {old_offer}:
        return NEW-OFFER-AMOUNT;
    Else:
        return {old_offer};
Else:
    return {old_offer};

Do NOT include text. I ONLY WANT the value itself.
DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANY WORDS.
