<INSTRUCTIONS>
I am going to give you an $EMAIL that is part of a salary negotiation.
They will be discussing the correct SALARY AMOUNT as part of the negotiation.

Return the value that is {compare} between the new offer in the EMAIL and {old_offer};


First:
    Please give me your full reasoning. I need two sentences that refer to the two values in question, as well as your
    reasoning for which one is {compare}.
Then:
    Please return a FINAL JUDGMENT, which is the value you are deciding is the {compare} among the known given values. This needs to be the LAST PART
    of your response.
